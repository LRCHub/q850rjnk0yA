This is how I show my love
I made it in my mind because
I blame it on my A. D. D., baby

This is how an angel dies
Blame it on my own sick pride
Blame it on my A. D. D., baby

Maybe I should cry for help
Maybe I should kill myself (myself)
Blame it on my A. D. D., baby

Maybe I'm a different breed
Maybe I'm not listening
So blame it on my A. D. D., baby
