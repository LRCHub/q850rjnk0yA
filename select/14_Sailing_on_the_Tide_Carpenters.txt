Here I am feeling confined
Neon lights are making me blind
I need time out in the sunshine
The city and me just don't agree
On who I should be
Maybe I should get away
Take myself a holiday

No more calls begging my time
No more walls for me to climb
I can't wait to feel the sunshine
Leaving at dawn
After I'm gone life go on
Someone's gonna take my place
Runnin'n in the human race

Sailing on the tide in the morning
Now I love that salty air
Sailing to the wide horizon
Let the fresh winds guide us there
Maybe if you feel like it too
You might like to make the run
Over the ocean
To my beautiful island in the sun

Over there people are slow
Low key life is all that they know
Lying around high on the sunshine
Lazy lagoons warm afternoons
Tropical moons
Sleepy beaches everywhere
Anyone is welcome there

Make no plans play it by ear
Could be days maybe a year
I'm gonna be free in the sunshine
Takin' my time tryin' to find
Some peace of mind
Nothin's gonna hurry me
Nothin's gonna worry me

Sailing on the tide in the morning
Now I love that salty air
Sailing to the wide horizon
Let the fresh winds guide us there
Maybe if you feel like it too
You might like to make the run
Over the ocean
To my beautiful island in the sun

Sailing to the wide horizon
Let the fresh winds guide us there
Maybe if you feel like it too
You might like to make the run
Over the ocean
To my beatiful island in the sun
